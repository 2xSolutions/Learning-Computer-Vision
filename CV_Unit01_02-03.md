# Unit 01 - Weeks 02-03 (Color Spaces and Image Filtering)

## Part A: Color Spaces

## 1) Color Physics and Chromaticity
- Visible light is roughly 400nm to 700nm wavelength.
- Prism experiments show white light splits into spectral components.
- **Chromaticity** describes color information (hue/saturation) without brightness.
- Separating brightness from color helps with robust color-based analysis.

## 2) Why Color Spaces Matter
- A color space is a numerical system for representing colors.
- Different tasks/devices prefer different color spaces.

## 3) Main Color Spaces
- **Grayscale:** one channel (intensity only), fast and memory efficient.
- **RGB (additive):** common for displays/cameras; channels are red/green/blue.
- **HSV:** separates hue/saturation/value; often easier for human interpretation.
- **Lab (CIELAB):** closer to human perception (more perceptually uniform).
- **CMYK (subtractive):** used in printing (cyan, magenta, yellow, black).

## 4) Additive vs Subtractive Models
- **Additive (RGB):** adding light increases brightness.
- **Subtractive (CMYK):** inks absorb wavelengths from white light.

## 5) Assignment Note (from slides)
- Convert images into multiple color spaces and inspect channels.
- Remove brightness channel where relevant and compare outputs.

## Part B: Image Filtering

## 6) What is Image Filtering?
- Filtering modifies/enhances images by applying a kernel (small matrix).
- Common goals: denoising, smoothing, sharpening, edge extraction, preprocessing.

## 7) Filtering Domains
- **Spatial domain:** operate directly on pixel values.
- **Frequency domain:** transform (Fourier), filter frequencies, then inverse transform.

## 8) Frequency-Domain Idea
- **Low-pass filter:** keeps low frequencies (smooth regions), suppresses edges/noise.
- **High-pass behavior:** emphasizes edges/details (high-frequency components).

## 9) Linear Filtering
- Output is a weighted sum of neighboring pixels (convolution/correlation).
- Common linear filters:
  - Box/Average filter (simple smoothing)
  - Gaussian filter (smoothing with center-weighted kernel)
  - Sharpening filters (Laplacian, LoG, High-boost)
  - Edge filters (Sobel, Prewitt)
  - Directional filters (e.g., Gabor)

## 10) Non-Linear Filtering
- Output is not a linear weighted sum.
- **Median filter:** strong for salt-and-pepper noise, preserves edges better than mean filter.
- **Canny edge detector:** multi-step robust edge detection
  - noise reduction
  - gradient computation
  - non-maximum suppression
  - double threshold
  - edge tracking by hysteresis

## 11) Quick Summary
- Color spaces are crucial for proper image representation and analysis.
- Filtering is central to image enhancement and feature preparation.
- Different filters are chosen based on task (noise removal, edge detection, texture emphasis).
